# Process for 3D Scanning and Manufacturing of Custom Orthotics

Repository for 3D scanning of humans and subsequent digital post-processing for 3D printing of orthotics, as well as the physical post-processing for the use of these orthotics.

## Project Description

The main focus has been on the **digital post-processing of the scans performed**, exploring its application in the custom manufacturing of orthotics. With the support and resources provided by **FabLab UV**, the ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of advanced technologies in the field of custom and accessible orthotics.

## Current Project Objectives

1. **3D Scanning:**
   Using various scanners, whether specialized or not, we can obtain similar results as extreme precision is not required. Additionally, we have collected the necessary data to perform the three-dimensional scan of the human anatomy, ensuring the correct positioning of the part to be scanned.

2. **Processing for 3D Modeling:**
   We implemented algorithms to filter and prepare the captured data, thus facilitating precise 3D modeling in various modeling software.

3. **3D Printing of Custom Orthotics:**
   We explored integration in the custom design of orthotics, allowing precise manufacturing tailored to individual needs, taking into account the desired material for the conditions in which it will be used.

4. **Physical Post-Processing of Printed Orthotics:**
   We developed methods for the physical post-processing of printed orthotics, ensuring a comfortable and functional fit.
